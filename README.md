# _mandrill++_

_mandrill++_ is a Python re-implementation of mandrill, introducing many more _exciting_ features. 

## Overview

The original _mandrill_ language (**not** _mandrill++_, and also not the enhanced _mandrill_ language in this repository) was designed to be as simple to implement of a language (using standard methods) as possible. This introduced features like:

- not much abstraction (no functions, classes, etc.)
- redundant grammar (many mandatory braces, mandatory `else` structures after `if` structures, etc.)
- no data structure (not even arrays!)
- no types (just integers.)

The _mandrill++_ language changes this. In _mandrill++_, we provide more elegant pieces of grammar, more constructs, and Macros that helps eliminate the redundancy within your code. However, _mandrill++_ is still designed to be a simplistic language. In this documentation, we will show you how to write in (**not** implement) _mandrill++_ (not assuming any previous experience in _mandrill_ or even programming). Programmers who find the entire tutorial wordy can skip ahead to the information dump and examples section.
